**ðŸŽ¨ðŸ§  Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion**
This project demonstrates the use of Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art text-to-image model, to generate high-quality images from natural language prompts. By leveraging the diffusers library by Hugging Face, the project uses the runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 model to turn imagination into visualsâ€”just by typing a sentence!

**ðŸ’¡ What This Project Does:**
 Loads a pre-trained Stable Diffusion pipeline using Hugging Face diffusers

 Accepts a custom input prompt from the user

 Generates a unique image based on the given description

 Displays and saves the output image locally (generated_image.png)

 Automatically uses GPU (CUDA) if available, for faster generation

This project is a great entry point to text-to-image generation and exploring creative applications of Generative AI. Just type in a prompt like "A futuristic city on Mars during sunset" and watch it come to life!
